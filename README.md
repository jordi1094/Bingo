This is a small Bingo game written in JavaScript.

To run it, it is necessary to install:

Node.js
npm prompt-sync
It generates two random grids of numbers with 3 rows and 5 columns each. The first row generates a random number from 1 to 20, the second a random number from 21 to 40, and so on till 100.

In every round, the console displays the number for that round, the list of numbers played, and the two grids with the played numbers in a string format, highlighted in a different color.

When all the numbers from the same row are played, the word "linea" appears. This is the term used in Spain to announce the winner of the first prize.

When all the numbers from one grid are played, the end of the game is announced with the name of the winner and their grid.

I hope this little project seems interesting to you.
